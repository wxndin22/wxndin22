## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Wandi Ndlazi - a fourth-year student at Seattle Pacific University studying Accounting and Data Analytics.
My goal is to become a Chartered Accountant, and I am committed to achieving this through hard work and continuous learning. With a keen interest in data analytics, I am excited to explore the intersection of accounting and technology to drive informed decision-making and create value for organizations.
